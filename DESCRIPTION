Description: Functions to check variables against a
    set of data quality rules. A rule file can be accompanied by look-up tables. In
    addition, there are some convenience functions that may
    serve as an example for defining clearer 'data rules'. An
    HTML based user interface facilitates initial exploration of the
    functionality.
