\title{Check a table against a set of constraints or rules defined in R.}
\description{
The rules can be written in standard R syntax.
A rule must contain the names of 'columns' or variables present in the table
and use R operators or simple functions. If not, the rule will simply be ignored.
Each line must 'test' one rule and return a vector of boolean values as many as the
table has rows. Rules must not contain an assignment. The set of rules is simply
defined as a set of R statements and can be mixed with empty lines and comments.
Comments after a rule will be used for summarizing rule check results in a table and
should therefore be short - usually short names. This allows to visually organize
rules in a file and also document them. One may put more extensive comments just
before the rule and add a short name or comment on the same line after it. This also
allows to use standard R editors for development of the rules.
}
\details{
A simple score is calculated based on the number of rules a datapoint (= table cell)
complies with. Like in a school test only the number of correct answers (or rule compliances)
are counted. Summaries of scores by row (record) and column (variable) are added to a
score data frame.

The table itself must be a simple dataframe or .csv file.

The package includes a simple graphical user interface as a web page.
This can be started with
\code{run_datacheck()}. This interface shows summaries of the checks by rule and by
record. The score table can be 'downloaded'. The user interface is meant as an easy
way to get to know the package. All results can be also created using the command line
interface of R.

The main function and the principal example can be found under \code{datadict_profile}.

Several helper functions like \code{is_proper_name} or \code{is_only_lowers} are for convenience
and illustration on how to express rules more clearly or succinct.
